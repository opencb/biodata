    Evidence of pathogenicity and benign impact as defined in Richards, S. et al. (2015). Standards and guidelines for the interpretation

    the Association for Molecular Pathology. Genetics in Medicine, 17(5), 405–423. https://doi.org/10.1038/gim.2015.30

Evidence of pathogenicity:
* `very_strong`:
    - PVS1 null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon
    deletion) in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease
* `strong`:
    - PS1 Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change
    - PS2 De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history
    - PS3 Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene
    product
    - PS4 The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence
    in controls
* `moderate`:
    - PM1 Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of
    an enzyme) without benign variation
    - PM2 Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes
    Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium
    - PM3 For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant
    - PM4 Protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletions/insertions in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss
    variants
    - PM5 Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic
    has been seen before
    - PM6 Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity
* `supporting`:
    - PP1 Cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the
    disease
    - PP2 Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants are
    a common mechanism of disease
    - PP3 Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product
    (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)
    - PP4 Patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology
    - PP5 Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory
    to perform an independent evaluation

Evidence of benign impact:
* `stand_alone`:
    - BA1 Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation
    Consortium
* `strong`:
    - BS1 Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder
    - BS2 Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked
    (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age
    - BS3 Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or
    splicing
    - BS4 Lack of segregation in affected members of a family
* `supporting`:
    - BP1 Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease
    - BP2 Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis
    with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern
    - BP3 In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function
    - BP4 Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact on gene or gene product (conservation,
    evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)
    - BP5 Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease
    - BP6 Reputable source recently reports variant as benign, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to
    perform an independent evaluation
    - BP7 A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice
    consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved
